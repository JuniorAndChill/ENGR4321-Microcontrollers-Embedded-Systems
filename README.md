# ENGR 4321 Microcontroller and Embedded Systems
## [Wokwi] Simulation Assignments

Template for projects using Redboard, SunFounder, etc. microcontroller project kits for reports. Reports are due Mondays.

### Background
The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to microcontroller-based system design through simulation
using the ESP32 SoC platform and to publish your work on your GitHub account. This assignment emphasizes
understanding 32-bit hardware-software interaction, GPIO management, and the use of GitHub for professional
engineering documentation.
